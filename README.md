Product Management: Admin can add, update, or delete products, manage inventory, and handle categories.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout.



Technologies Used:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, REST API

Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)

Frontend: Angular (if applicable)



Other Tools: Mongoose (for MongoDB ODM), Postman (for API testing)

This project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of modern web development practices, including RESTful API design, server-side logic, database integration, and front-end development in the MEAN stack ecosystem.
